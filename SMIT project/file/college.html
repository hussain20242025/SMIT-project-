                    which it is carved, is an ancient
                    archaeological site in Jordan. Once a thriving capital of the Nabataean Kingdom around 300 BCE,
                    Petra is renowned for
                    its stunning rock-cut architecture, including the famous Al-Khazneh (The Treasury). Hidden within
                    rugged mountains, the
                    city remained unknown to the Western world until its rediscovery in 1812. Today, Petra is a UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site
                    and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, attracting visitors with its unique beauty and

                    in the heart of the city. Built
                    between AD 70 and 80 under the Flavian emperors, it was primarily used for gladiatorial contests,
                    public spectacles, and
                    dramas. With a seating capacity of around 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum is renowned for its
                    architectural and
                    engineering marvel, featuring a complex system of vaults, arches, and underground chambers. Despite
                    centuries of wear
                    and damage, the Colosseum remains a testament to the grandeur of Roman civilization and is one of
                    the most visited
                    historical landmarks in the world.
